Directory-Queue

The goal of this module is to offer a simple queue system using the
underlying filesystem for storage, security and to prevent race
conditions via atomic operations. It focuses on simplicity, robustness
and scalability.

This module allows multiple concurrent readers and writers to interact
with the same queue. A Python implementation of the same algorithm is
available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dirq/ so readers and writers
can be written in different programming languages.
